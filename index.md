# Kevin Putnam

I am an expert at taking software projects from ideation to delivery. I’ve been
successful in multiple domains, whether working with low level stat collection,
storage test automation, or documentation tools. I use a holistic approach
grounded in sound design principles, and I’m able to balance all aspects of
application design to deliver stable, high quality applications that are just
complex enough.

I started my career as a validation engineer. I know how to test, and I know how to find edge cases.
