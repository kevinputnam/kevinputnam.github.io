# Kevin Putnam - Developer

I am an expert at taking software projects from ideation to delivery. I’ve been
successful in multiple domains, whether working with low level stat collection,
storage test automation, or documentation tools. I use a holistic approach
grounded in sound design principles, and I’m able to balance all aspects of
application design to deliver stable, high quality applications that are just
complex enough.

## About Me

- Entrepreneurial. If I see an opportunity for innovation, I will advocate and deliver.
- Storage Technologies R&D taught me that a demo is worth ten presentations (or more).
- Primarily Python (often using Tkinter) but C++/.NET, HTML/CSS/JS, and a few others.
- I’m a quick study and will learn any framework. Novelty is the spice of life, after all.
- Please don’t ask me to make a shim. I’ll do it, but I will also push back hard.
- Very independent and self-directed as well as enjoying teamwork.
- I love to mentor and learn
- Results oriented
