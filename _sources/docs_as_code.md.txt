# Documentation as Code

Is a documentation workflow that inherits key tools and processes from inner and open source software development:

* Issue Trackers
* Version Control
* Plain Text Markup 
* Code Reviews
* Automated Test and Deployment

See [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) for more information.

## FAQ

Why should I consider moving to "docs as code" from my current solution?
: To own the means of production. The tools are open
  source and freely available. It means no longer being locked into a
  proprietary walled garden. It also means more work, so it isn’t for
  everyone. Just as the dev team owns the source code, writers, editors, and
  designers can own the docs from top to bottom resulting in improved quality
  and reduced response times.
