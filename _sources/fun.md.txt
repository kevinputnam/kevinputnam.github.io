## [Black Ocean](https://kevinputnam.github.io/blackocean/)

A website I built that uses a custom HTML generator based on Docutils. I used it as a means to learn more about how Docutils works and explore a different approach to creating the table of contents. Sphinx generates a relative table of contents for each page, whereas this site uses a frame to host a single copy of the table of contents that only loads once. While it is far less complex than Sphinx, it is suitable for many sites.

## Basic Adventure Game

There are a lot of 2D game engines out there that are way more complex than I need. I set out to learn how to use HTML 5 and canvases to create my own engine and share code with an in-browser game editor with no additional dependencies. Very much alpha software, but also still in development.
