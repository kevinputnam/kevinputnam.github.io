# Validation

I began my career in SSD and firmware testing, where failure analysis and edge
cases are a daily reality. That mindset has carried forward into my work across
software and documentation.

For the past seven years, I’ve worked at the intersection of customers,
engineering, and documentation. As a validation engineer by training, I focus
on how systems, and the materials that support them hold up in real-world use,
not just in ideal scenarios.

Documentation validation isn’t glamorous, but it directly impacts adoption,
support load, and customer trust. For companies building complex technology,
unclear or incorrect documentation is a hidden business risk.

I offer a one-week engagement focused on a single software stack. The goal is
to evaluate whether the documentation enables customers to succeed, where it
introduces friction, and where it may actively block adoption. This can include
high-level reviews of tutorials and guides, or targeted analysis of known
problem areas.

The engagement concludes with a concise, prioritized report highlighting what
is working (green), what needs improvement (yellow), and what is likely broken 
red), giving leadership a clear view of risk, impact, and next steps.
